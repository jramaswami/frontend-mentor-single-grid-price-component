## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about responsive web design using media queries.  I used mobile first
development to layout the web page for a small screen first.  Then I added
a media query and the necessary CSS to alter the layout to match the desktop
design.

### Continued development

This was really basic, involving only style and layout.  I am looking forward
to challenges that will include behavior as well.
